This project defines the **Agent Tool Description Format (ATDF)**, a standardized way to describe tools for AI agents. You can find the detailed specification, examples, and contribution guidelines in the language-specific sections linked above.

This repository also includes a Python SDK to help work with the ATDF format. More details about the SDK can be found in the main [README.md](../../README.md).
